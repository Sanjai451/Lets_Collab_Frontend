# Let's Collab

## Overview

**Let's Collab** is a real-time collaboration platform built using **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO**. It allows multiple users to join a single room and work collaboratively in three different modes:

- **Typing Mode**: Users can write and edit text together.
- **Drawing Mode**: Users can collaboratively draw on a shared canvas.
- **Coding Mode**: Users can write and edit code in real-time.

The application ensures data persistence by using **SessionStorage** for storing in-session code and **MongoDB** for long-term storage.

## Features

âœ… **Real-time Collaboration** â€“ Users can join rooms and collaborate in real time.

âœ… **Multiple Modes** â€“ Choose between text editing, drawing, or coding.

âœ… **Persistent Code Storage** â€“ Uses **SessionStorage** for session-based storage and **MongoDB** for saving typed content.

âœ… **Socket.IO Integration** â€“ Ensures smooth real-time updates between connected users.

âœ… **Multi-user Rooms** â€“ Multiple users can join and collaborate on the same project simultaneously.

## How It Works

### ðŸ”¹ Creating & Joining a Room

1. Open the application and create a new collaboration room.
2. Share the unique room ID with other participants.
3. Users can join the same room and collaborate in real time.

### ðŸ”¹ Choosing Collaboration Mode

- **Text Mode**: Type and edit text collaboratively.
- **Drawing Mode**: Use a shared whiteboard for sketching ideas.
- **Code Mode**: Write and edit code together.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Persistence

- **SessionStorage**: Stores code temporarily within the session.
- **LocalStorage**: Stores the Room ID to manage session.
- **MongoDB**: Saves user-typed content for future retrieval.

## Future Enhancements

ðŸ”¹ **User Authentication** â€“ Implement login/signup with JWT authentication.

ðŸ”¹ **Syntax Highlighting** â€“ Improve code mode with syntax highlighting.

ðŸ”¹ **Version Control** â€“ Track changes and allow users to revert edits.

ðŸ”¹ **Files** â€“ Allow users to file from their computer.
